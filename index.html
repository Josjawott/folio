		<p>Yo! <br>
I'm Joshua Ryan, a 16 year old Assumption College student who likes music. And video games. Lots of video games.<br>
<br>
It's pretty much the only way I spend my free time...<br>
<br>
Game development isn't something that I gave much thought to when I was younger. But recently I've come to appreciate the hard work, the innovation and creativity of independent game developers.<br>
<br>
(It almost feels like the work they put out surpasses the high budgets of AAA game developers!)<br>
<br>
My main inspirations for game development include ConcernedApe, Toby Fox and Pillow Fight.

		<h1>What The Heck Do I Do?</h1>
		<p>As of 2021, I am taking a two-year VET Screen and Media course at Assumption College, taught by Mr Stewart. As a matter of fact, this website was <a href="year1/sac1/sac1.html">created</a> for this course! It was very exciting to dip my toes into HTML and CSS, and I am incredibly pleased with what I've done.<br>
<br>
			One of the things that I am most looking forward to in this class is <a href="year1/sac3/sac3.html">designing</a> and <a href="year1/sac4/sac4.html">creating</a>
			a video game environment with assets. 
			The closest thing I've done in the past is recreating some of my favourite structures, both from the real and digital world, in sandbox games, so it is definitely intriguing to learn how I can expand my creativity through other mediums.</p><br>
