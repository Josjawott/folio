		<h1>SAC4 - Create a 3D Diorama</h1>
		<p>For SAC4 I was tasked with creating the 3D diorama that I designed in SAC3. I used the software Autodesk Maya <br>
to model my assets, Adobe Photoshop for textures, and Unreal Engine 4 to place and position my assets.<br>
		<br>
		This was the first time I had modelled a 3D object, so it was exciting to learn a new skill.<br>
		<br>
		Despite working mostly from home, I am pretty happy with the finished product and would definitely experiment with making models in my own time.</p>
