		<h1>SAC3 - 3D Diorama Design</h1>
		<p>For SAC3, I was tasked with designing a 3D environment/diorama, complete with assets, which I then created in SAC4 using Autodesk Maya, Adobe Photoshop, and Unreal Engine.<br>
<br>
My diorama was a caf√© in an otherworldly jungle setting. I experimented with vibrant and unnatural colours that you wouldn't find in an ordinary jungle.<br>
<br>
My assets included a log stool, a cracked egg cup, and a bar stand surrounding an enormous tree.</p>
